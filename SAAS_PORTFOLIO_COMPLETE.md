## 🎯 STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES

### 1. **DISTRIBUTION OVER PRODUCT**
- Booking/Procurement: Direct sales to Finance Directors (warm intros)
- GDPR: SEO content marketing ("GDPR compliance" = 8,900 searches/month)
- French AI: Freemium (low friction) + LinkedIn organic
- Africa: Partner with telecom, MFIs, schools (distribution moats)

### 2. **REGULATORY MOAT**
Services with compliance requirements = recurring revenue + high switching costs:
- ✅ GDPR Audit (€2.3B TAM, 24% CAGR)
- ✅ AI Act Compliance (€720M TAM, new market 2025)
- ✅ ESG/CSRD (€12.4B TAM, mandatory by 2027)

### 3. **VERTICAL EXPANSION PATH**
Start horizontal (booking/procurement), expand by industry:
- **Phase 1**: Travel/hospitality (booking focus)
- **Phase 2**: Manufacturing (procurement + maintenance)
- **Phase 3**: Finance/services, healthcare, government

### 4. **INTERNATIONAL HIRING**
- **Europe team**: Build in EU (compliance, time zones, talent)
- **Africa team**: Hire locally (cultural knowledge, distribution, support)
- **French speakers**: Hire globally (remote talent for French AI service)

### 5. **NETWORK EFFECTS & SWITCHING COSTS**
- **Booking**: Community marketplaces (supplier network = moat)
- **French AI**: Team features (shared calendars, meeting insights)
- **Mobile Money**: Multi-vendor integration (once plugged in, hard to switch)
