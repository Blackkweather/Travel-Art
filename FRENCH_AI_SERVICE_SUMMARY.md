## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Perfect for French Market**: Email/calendar pain is universal, but French professionals have specific needs (CNIL/RGPD privacy focus, preference for French-language tools)

2. **High Retention**: Unlike fitness/gaming apps, productivity tools have natural stickiness. 2+ hours/day value = low churn.

3. **Horizontal Advantage**: Only solution addressing email + calendar + notifications together. Competitors fragmented (Superhuman for email, Calendly for scheduling, separate notification apps).

4. **Pricing Power**: Executives save €84,000+/year → willingly pay €1,500-2,000/year. At €149/month = 12% of value captured.

5. **Expansion Path**: Once proven in French market, can:
   - Expand language variants (Spanish, Portuguese, Italian)
   - Add team features (shared calendars, team insights)
   - Integrate with CRM/project management
   - Become hub for all professional communications
