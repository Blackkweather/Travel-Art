```

## Environment Setup

### For Development Testing:
Create `frontend/.env` with:
```env
VITE_USE_CLOUDINARY=true
VITE_CDN_PROVIDER=cloudinary
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=desowqsmy
VITE_CLOUDINARY_VERSION=v1761401364
```

### For Production Deployment:
Set these environment variables:
- `VITE_USE_CLOUDINARY=true`
- `VITE_CDN_PROVIDER=cloudinary`
- `VITE_API_URL=[your-production-api-url]`

## What's Fixed:
1. ✅ Assets configuration updated to use working Cloudinary URL
2. ✅ Environment detection improved for production
3. ✅ All logo types now use the confirmed working URL
4. ✅ Console logging added for debugging

## Test Your Application:
1. Open http://localhost:3002/ (or whatever port Vite assigns)
2. Check browser console for "✅ Using Cloudinary config (PRODUCTION READY)"
3. Logo should now display correctly in header and throughout app

## Production Deployment:
Your logo will work in production because:
- The Cloudinary URL is confirmed working ✅
- The configuration automatically uses Cloudinary in production mode
- All logo variants point to the working URL
